Machine Learning Perfume Recommender

This Perfume Recommender is a consumer-driven tool to find fragrances that match a user's request for a certain scent. It uses the Bag-Of-Words model to sort the dataset and clusters the perfumes with similar types of fragrances. Then a Bayesian Inference model is used to find similarities between the user prompt and clusters to find associated perfumes, which are then displayed according to price and reviews. 

It has a basic Flask and React.js stack to run it as a web app, however these are still in development.
